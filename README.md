The one-dimensional single-particle Schr√∂dinger equation is solved numerically by making use of the Fourier represenation of the Hamiltonian. Examples for various potentials are given, additionally scatterings phases are studied. The implementation follows the [script](https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de/com/teachingandseminars/previousCPII) by Ulli Wolff and Tomasz Korzec.
