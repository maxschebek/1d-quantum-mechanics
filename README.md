The one-dimensional single-particle Schrödinger equation is solved numerically by making use of the Fourier represenation of the Hamiltonian. Examples for various potentials are given, additionally scatterings phases are studied. The implementation follows the [script](https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de/com/teachingandseminars/previousCPII) by Ulli Wolff and Tomasz Korzec.

In addition, a neural network is trained to learn the solution of the Schrödinger equation from randomly generated potentials.
